# Part I: Introduction and Overview

This foundational section establishes the essential concepts, terminology, and strategic context for IT Portfolio Management within the broader ITIL/ITSM framework.

## What You'll Learn

Part I provides the conceptual foundation necessary for understanding and implementing IT Portfolio Management effectively. Before diving into detailed processes and governance structures, it is essential to establish a shared understanding of what portfolio management means, why it matters, and how it connects to organizational strategy.

Organizations that skip this foundational work often struggle with portfolio management implementation. Without clear understanding of core concepts, stakeholders may have conflicting expectations about what portfolio management should deliver. Without strategic alignment, portfolio decisions become disconnected from business objectives.
