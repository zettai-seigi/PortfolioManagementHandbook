# Part II: Framework and Process

This section provides the detailed process framework for IT Portfolio Management, covering the complete lifecycle from demand intake through benefits realization.

## What You'll Learn

Part II transforms the conceptual foundation from Part I into actionable processes. Understanding the "what" and "why" of portfolio management is necessary but not sufficient—organizations must also master the "how." This section provides the detailed process activities, decision frameworks, and optimization techniques that enable effective portfolio management.

The stage-gate investment lifecycle ensures investments are properly evaluated at each decision point. The scoring and prioritization framework enables objective, data-driven decisions. Portfolio balancing techniques ensure resources are allocated appropriately across strategic categories.
