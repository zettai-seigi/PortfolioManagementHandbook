# Part III: Governance and Organization

This section establishes the governance structures, organizational roles, policies, and metrics necessary to sustain effective IT Portfolio Management.

## What You'll Learn

Part III addresses the organizational aspects of portfolio management that determine long-term success. Even the best-designed processes will fail without appropriate governance structures, clear role definitions, supportive policies, and meaningful metrics.

Effective governance provides the decision-making framework that ensures portfolio decisions are made at the right level by the right people with the right information. Clear roles and responsibilities prevent gaps and overlaps that lead to confusion and delays. Well-designed policies establish guardrails that guide behavior without creating bureaucratic obstacles. Comprehensive metrics enable performance tracking and continuous improvement.
