## Portfolio Governance Best Practices

### 1. Establish Clear Governance Structure

**Best Practice:** Create a three-tier governance model with clear authority and accountability.

| Tier | Body | Meeting Frequency | Authority |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Strategic | Portfolio Steering Committee | Monthly | Major decisions, strategy |
| Tactical | Investment Review Board | Bi-weekly | Investment evaluation |
| Operational | Portfolio Management Office | Continuous | Day-to-day operations |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Define clear charters for each body

### 2. Implement Disciplined Investment Process

**Best Practice:** Use stage-gate process with defined criteria at each gate.

**Stage-Gate Framework:**

| Gate | Focus | Key Question |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Gate 1 | Idea | Is this aligned to strategy? |
| Gate 2 | Business Case | Is the investment justified? |
| Gate 3 | Plan | Is the plan realistic? |
| Gate 4 | Execute | Are we ready to start? |
| Gate 5 | Deploy | Are we ready to go live? |
| Gate 6 | Close | Did we deliver? |
| Gate 7 | Benefits | Did we realize value? |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Don't skip gates for "urgent" requests
- Require complete deliverables before gate review
- Document gate decisions and rationale
- Allow fast-track for small, low-risk investments

### 3. Maintain Portfolio Discipline

**Best Practice:** Enforce consistent policies and resist exceptions.

**Key Principles:**

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No Unfunded Initiatives** | Every initiative must have approved budget |
| **Capacity-Based Planning** | Size portfolio to available capacity |
| **Say "No"** | Defer low-priority requests |
| **Transparent Decisions** | Communicate decisions with rationale |
| **Benefits Accountability** | Business sponsors own benefits |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Publish prioritization criteria

## Portfolio Optimization Best Practices

### 4. Balance the Portfolio

**Best Practice:** Maintain balance across multiple dimensions.

**Balance Dimensions:**

| Dimension | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Strategic (Transform/Grow) | 40-50% | Drive growth and innovation |
| Operational (Run/Comply) | 50-60% | Maintain operations |
| High Risk | 15-25% | Limit exposure |
| Quick Wins (< 6 months) | 30-40% | Maintain momentum |
| Innovation (Transformational) | 10% | Future capabilities |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Set explicit category targets
- Review balance quarterly
- Adjust allocation based on strategic priorities
- Avoid over-correction

### 5. Actively Manage Demand

**Best Practice:** Shape demand to match capacity rather than overcommitting.

**Demand Management Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Single Intake** | All requests through one channel |
| **Challenge** | Question necessity and alternatives |
| **Bundle** | Combine related requests |
| **Defer** | Move low-priority to next cycle |
| **Self-Service** | Enable business self-service |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Establish clear intake process
- Set realistic expectations

- Track utilization by skill
- Avoid over-reliance on key individuals
- Plan for skill development

## Benefits Realization Best Practices

### 7. Define Measurable Benefits

**Best Practice:** Every investment should have clear, measurable benefits.

**Good Benefit Statement:**
```
"Reduce order processing time from 45 minutes to 15 minutes per order,
saving 2 FTE ($160K annually), measured by system logs, tracked monthly,
realized 3 months post-implementation."
```

**Poor Benefit Statement:**
```
"Improve operational efficiency."
```

**Benefits Checklist:**
- [ ] Benefit clearly stated
- [ ] Success metric defined
- [ ] Baseline measured
- [ ] Target quantified
- [ ] Measurement method defined
- [ ] Benefit owner assigned
- [ ] Timeline established

### 8. Track Benefits Post-Implementation

**Best Practice:** Continue tracking benefits for 12-18 months after go-live.

**Tracking Process:**

| Phase | Timing | Activities |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Baseline | Before project | Measure current state |
| Stabilization | 0-3 months | Monitor adoption |
| Realization | 3-12 months | Measure benefits |
| Optimization | 12+ months | Maximize value |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Assign dedicated benefit owners
- Establish regular reporting cadence
- Take corrective action when off-track
- Celebrate and communicate success

### 9. Hold Business Accountable

**Best Practice:** Business sponsors own benefits realization, not IT.

**Accountability Model:**

| PMO | Tracking and reporting |
| Benefits Owner | Measurement and action |

**Implementation Tips:**
