## Investment Categories

### The Transform-Grow-Run-Comply Model

IT investments are categorized based on their strategic intent:

| Category | Description | Examples | Target Allocation |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Transform** | New capabilities, innovation, strategic change | Digital transformation, new products | 15-25% |
| **Grow** | Expand existing capabilities, market growth | Feature enhancements, capacity expansion | 20-30% |
| **Run** | Maintain current operations, keep lights on | Maintenance, upgrades, technical debt | 40-50% |
| **Comply/Secure** | Regulatory, compliance, security requirements | Audit remediation, security patches | 10-15% |

### Category Definitions

**Transform (Strategic Transformation)**
- New business capabilities not currently available
- Disruptive or innovative initiatives
- High risk, high potential reward
- Typically longer timeframes
- Example: New e-commerce platform, AI implementation

**Grow (Business Growth)**
- Enhancements to existing capabilities
- Market expansion, customer acquisition
- Moderate risk, moderate reward
- Medium-term initiatives
- Example: Mobile app enhancements, capacity expansion

**Run (Operational Maintenance)**
- Keep current systems operational
- Technical debt reduction
- Routine upgrades and maintenance
- Lower risk, lower direct return
- Example: Infrastructure upgrades, application patches

**Comply/Secure (Compliance and Security)**
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Security enhancements
- Risk mitigation
- Mandatory investments
- Example: GDPR compliance, security certifications

### Investment Category Balance

## Application Portfolio Categories

### TIME Model (Technology-Information-Market-Enterprise)

Applications are categorized based on business value and strategic intent:

| Category | Business Value | Strategic Intent | Investment Strategy |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Strategic** | High | Differentiate, enable growth | Invest heavily |
| **Core** | Medium-High | Support critical operations | Maintain and enhance |
| **Support** | Medium-Low | Enable business functions | Minimize investment |
| **Retire** | Low | Candidate for retirement | Phase out |

### Application Category Definitions

**Strategic Applications**
- Provide competitive advantage
- Enable strategic business capabilities
- High business impact if unavailable
- Differentiate from competitors
- Examples: Customer-facing platforms, analytics engines

**Core Applications**
- Support critical business operations
- High reliability requirements
- Standardized, well-established
- Essential but not differentiating
- Examples: ERP systems, core banking

**Support Applications**
- Enable business functions
- Could be outsourced or replaced
- Lower business impact
- Commodity functionality
- Examples: HR systems, document management

**Retire Applications**
- Low business value
- Technical debt or risk
- Candidates for decommissioning
- Should be replaced or eliminated
- Examples: Legacy systems, redundant tools

### Application Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Description | Investment |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Emerging** | New application under development | High |
| **Growth** | Increasing adoption and capability | High |
| **Mature** | Stable, full adoption | Moderate |
| **Declining** | Decreasing value, being replaced | Low |
| **Retired** | No longer in use | None |

## Priority Framework

### Priority Matrix

Initiatives are prioritized based on combined scores:

| **P2 - High** | 3.5-5.0 | Significant value | Fund this cycle |
| **P3 - Medium** | 2.0-3.5 | Moderate value | Consider next cycle |
| **P4 - Low** | 0-2.0 | Limited value | Defer |
| **P5 - Do Not Fund** | <0 | No value or negative | Reject |

### Priority Calculation

```
Priority Score = (Business Value Score × 0.40) +
                 ((5 - Risk Score) × 0.30) +
                 ((5 - Cost Score) × 0.30)
```
