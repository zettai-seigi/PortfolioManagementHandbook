## Introduction: The Importance of Stage-Gate Discipline

The investment lifecycle represents one of the most critical frameworks in IT Portfolio Management, providing the structured approach through which investment ideas progress from conception to value realization. While many organizations recognize the need for investment governance, the difference between effective and ineffective governance often lies in the rigor and consistency with which stage-gate processes are implemented.

Stage-gate processes implement the principle of progressive commitment, where investments proceed through a series of decision points with increasing levels of scrutiny, detail, and resource commitment. Early gates require minimal investment to screen ideas and develop business cases. Later gates authorize significant funding only after detailed planning demonstrates viability. This progressive approach manages risk by preventing large commitments to poorly defined or questionable investments while enabling rapid advancement of well-justified initiatives.

The absence of disciplined stage-gate processes creates several predictable pathologies in portfolio management. Investments proceed to execution without adequate planning, business justification, or stakeholder alignment. Political influence or lobbying effectiveness determines which initiatives receive funding rather than objective evaluation against strategic priorities. Projects start with unclear scope, unrealistic budgets, and inadequate resources, leading to predictable failure. Benefits are never measured because they were never clearly defined. Lessons are never learned because there is no consistent process to improve.

Conversely, organizations that implement stage-gate discipline consistently achieve significantly better outcomes. Investments are aligned to strategy and properly justified before receiving major funding. Resources are allocated based on priority rather than whoever asks first or loudest. Projects have realistic plans, adequate resources, and clear success criteria. Benefits are tracked and organizations learn from both successes and failures. Portfolio governance becomes a source of value rather than bureaucratic overhead.

This chapter presents a comprehensive seven-gate investment lifecycle model that spans from initial idea qualification through benefits realization. Each gate serves a specific purpose, applies defined criteria, requires particular deliverables, and leads to explicit decision options. The model balances rigor with pragmatism, providing sufficient control to prevent waste while enabling appropriate speed and flexibility for different investment types.

The stage-gate framework presented here reflects best practices from leading organizations while remaining adaptable to different organizational contexts. Organizations should implement this framework as written for significant investments while applying appropriate fast-track variants for smaller, lower-risk initiatives. The key is consistency: once criteria are established, they must be applied uniformly to maintain credibility and objectivity.

## Stage-Gate Investment Process Overview

The stage-gate investment process provides a structured pathway from idea through benefits realization, with each gate representing a decision point where investments are evaluated against defined criteria before proceeding to the next stage. The seven-gate model presented here reflects the complete investment lifecycle:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This lifecycle model segments the investment journey into four major phases:

**Demand Management Phase (Gates 1-2)** focuses on capturing, qualifying, and justifying investment opportunities. Investments in this phase consume modest resources primarily for analysis and business case development. The goal is to identify viable opportunities worthy of detailed planning and weed out ideas that are misaligned, premature, or non-viable. Approximately 40-50% of ideas entering Gate 1 may be deferred or rejected by Gate 2, which represents healthy filtering rather than process failure.

**Planning Phase (Gate 3)** transitions justified investments into detailed execution plans with validated resource commitments, realistic schedules, and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies. Planning typically consumes 5-10% of total project investment and represents the last opportunity to refine the approach before major resource commitment. Organizations should resist pressure to abbreviate planning to "start faster," as inadequate planning inevitably results in execution delays, budget overruns, and scope compromises that far exceed planning time saved.

**Execution Phase (Gates 4-5)** encompasses the actual development, implementation, testing, and deployment of the approved solution. This phase consumes 80-90% of total project investment and requires active monitoring to ensure execution proceeds according to plan. Gates 4 and 5 serve as critical checkpoints to prevent false starts and premature deployments that create operational problems.

**Operations Phase (Gates 6-7)** transitions delivered solutions to steady-state operations, closes project activities, and validates that expected benefits are realized. This phase is frequently neglected, with projects lingering in ambiguous "mostly done" states and benefits never measured. Formal project closure and benefits tracking are essential for portfolio maturity and accountability.

### Progressive Commitment Principle

The stage-gate model implements progressive commitment through escalating decision authority and increasing resource allocation:

- **Gate 1** qualifies ideas with minimal investment (2-8 hours), decided by Portfolio Manager
- **Gate 2** approves business cases after modest investment (80-120 hours), decided by Investment Review Board
- **Gate 3** authorizes full execution after planning investment (5-10% of project), decided by Steering Committee
- **Gates 4-7** provide readiness checks, authorization, closure, and validation with appropriate decision authority

This progression ensures that significant resources are committed only after thorough evaluation and planning demonstrate viability. Organizations that skip gates or approve investments without meeting gate criteria inevitably experience higher failure rates and wasted resources.

---

## Gate 1: Idea Qualification

Gate 1 serves as the entry point into the formal portfolio management process, screening investment ideas to identify those worthy of detailed business case development while filtering out concepts that are misaligned, premature, duplicative, or non-viable.

### Purpose and Governance

The fundamental purpose of Gate 1 is to efficiently evaluate new investment ideas against strategic alignment, business need clarity, solution viability, and sponsor commitment. This initial screening prevents wasted effort developing detailed business cases for concepts that have fundamental flaws or misalignment. Gate 1 should be rapid (1-2 weeks from submission to decision) and require minimal documentation to encourage ideation while maintaining quality standards.

Decision authority for Gate 1 typically rests with the Portfolio Manager, potentially in consultation with business relationship managers, enterprise architects, or subject matter experts. This delegated authority enables rapid decisions without requiring governance body review for every idea. Portfolio Managers should have clear criteria and authority to advance, defer, or reject ideas at Gate 1.

### Entry Criteria

Investments enter Gate 1 when:
- An investment idea has been submitted through formal demand intake channels
- A business need or opportunity has been identified requiring potential investment
- An initial sponsor has been identified who is willing to champion the concept
- Minimum submission requirements have been met (typically concept paper or intake form)

Organizations should make Gate 1 entry as frictionless as possible to encourage innovation and opportunity identification. Overly bureaucratic intake processes discourage submission of valid ideas, particularly from business units that are not familiar with portfolio processes.

### Required Deliverables

Gate 1 requires relatively modest documentation, typically including:

**Concept Paper** (1-2 pages) provides a concise summary of the investment idea, articulating the core concept without extensive detail. The concept paper should address what problem or opportunity is being addressed, what solution approach is proposed, why this investment matters strategically, and what rough magnitude of investment is expected.

**Business Problem Statement** clearly describes the current state problem or opportunity, articulating business impact in terms that resonate with governance and stakeholder audiences. Effective problem statements quantify impact where possible (dollars, customers, regulatory exposure, competitive position) and create urgency that motivates action.

**Proposed Solution** outlines the high-level approach to addressing the business problem, providing enough detail to assess feasibility without premature commitment to specific implementation approaches. The solution description should identify what capabilities will be delivered, what major components or changes are required, and what alternative approaches were considered.

**Initial Estimate** provides a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for investment size, typically with -25%/+75% range. The estimate should address one-time implementation costs, ongoing operational costs, resource requirements, and expected timeline. Precision is neither expected nor desired at this stage; the goal is to classify investments as modest (less than $250K), significant ($250K-$1M), major ($1M-$5M), or transformational (greater than $5M).

**Strategic Alignment** demonstrates how the proposed investment maps to strategic objectives, business priorities, or regulatory requirements. This can be as simple as identifying which strategic objective(s) the investment supports and explaining the connection. Strategic alignment is the primary Gate 1 criterion; ideas that cannot articulate clear strategic alignment should not proceed regardless of other merits.

### Gate Review Process

Gate 1 review is typically performed by the Portfolio Manager with input from relevant experts:

**Initial Screening** verifies that the submission is complete, appropriate for portfolio intake, and not duplicative of existing work. Some submissions may be redirected to other processes (e.g., operational support requests, IT service requests) rather than portfolio investments.

**Strategic Alignment Assessment** validates that the proposed investment aligns with strategic objectives, business priorities, or mandatory requirements. This is the primary Gate 1 criterion. The assessment considers whether strategic alignment is clear and compelling, whether the investment addresses a genuine strategic need, and whether timing is appropriate given strategic priorities.

**Viability Assessment** evaluates whether the proposed solution approach appears technically and organizationally feasible. This preliminary assessment identifies obvious feasibility concerns (e.g., technology that doesn't exist, approaches that violate architecture standards, organizational changes that appear unrealistic) without conducting detailed analysis.

**Business Case Feasibility** assesses whether a credible business case could be developed for this investment. This includes considering whether benefits can be quantified and measured, whether costs are likely to be justified by benefits, and whether the investment magnitude is appropriate for the problem being addressed.

**Sponsor Commitment** validates that the identified sponsor has appropriate organizational authority, understands what sponsorship entails, and demonstrates genuine commitment rather than nominal support.

### Decision Criteria

Gate 1 applies pass/fail criteria across several dimensions:

| Criterion | Requirement | Assessment Approach |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Strategic Alignment** | Required | Maps clearly to strategic objectives or mandatory requirements |
| **Clear Business Need** | Required | Problem/opportunity articulated with quantified impact |
| **Viable Solution Approach** | Required | Technically and organizationally feasible |
| **Within Investment Parameters** | Required | Magnitude appropriate for organization's capacity |
| **Sponsor Commitment** | Required | Appropriate sponsor identified and committed |
| **Non-Duplicative** | Required | Not duplicating existing work or other initiatives |

All criteria must be met for an idea to advance through Gate 1. Failure on any criterion results in deferral or rejection.

### Decision Options

Gate 1 review results in one of three decision options:

**Advance to Gate 2** approves the concept for business case development, authorizing investment of analytical resources (typically 80-120 hours) to develop a comprehensive business case. Advancement includes assigning business case development resources, establishing a target date for Gate 2 review, clarifying any specific items that must be addressed in the business case, and confirming sponsor commitment to lead business case development.

**Defer** holds the idea for future consideration, typically due to timing issues, resource constraints, or need for strategic clarification. Deferred ideas remain in the demand backlog and may be reconsidered in future planning cycles. Deferral should include clear explanation of why the idea is being deferred and under what conditions it might be reconsidered.

**Reject** declines the idea, typically due to strategic misalignment, lack of viability, or inadequate business need. Rejection should be communicated clearly with rationale explaining the decision. Rejected ideas can be resubmitted if circumstances change, but rejection signals that the investment is not appropriate in its current form.

### Gate 1 Success Factors

Effective Gate 1 implementation requires several enabling conditions:

**Clear Submission Standards** define what information is required and provide templates that guide submission. Standards should be clear but not onerous, enabling quality while encouraging participation.

**Rapid Turnaround** from submission to decision (target 1-2 weeks) maintains momentum and demonstrates respect for sponsors' efforts. Slow turnaround discourages future submissions and signals that portfolio processes add bureaucracy rather than value.

**Transparent Criteria** enable sponsors to self-assess before submission and understand decision rationale. Publishing Gate 1 criteria, decision statistics, and example approvals/rejections helps calibrate expectations.

**Constructive Feedback** for deferred and rejected ideas helps sponsors understand the decision and potentially reframe or resubmit improved concepts. Feedback should be specific, actionable, and respectful.

**Consistent Application** of criteria across all submissions maintains credibility and prevents perceptions of favoritism or political decision-making.

## Gate 2: Business Case Approval

Gate 2 represents the first major decision point in the investment lifecycle, where comprehensive business cases are evaluated to authorize investment in detailed planning. This gate implements rigorous analysis and evaluation while remaining practical and decision-focused.

### Purpose and Governance

The fundamental purpose of Gate 2 is to evaluate detailed business justification, validate financial viability, assess risks, and determine whether to authorize planning investment. Gate 2 scrutiny is intentionally more rigorous than Gate 1 because approval authorizes significant resource investment (typically 5-10% of total project cost) for detailed planning.

Decision authority for Gate 2 typically rests with the Investment Review Board, a cross-functional governance body that includes representation from IT leadership, finance, enterprise architecture, business relationship management, and key business functions. The Investment Review Board typically has delegated authority to approve investments up to defined thresholds (e.g., $1M), with larger investments requiring Steering Committee approval.

### Entry Criteria

Investments enter Gate 2 when:
- Gate 1 approval has been granted authorizing business case development
- A business sponsor has been formally assigned with appropriate organizational authority
- A project manager has been assigned to lead planning and potentially execution
- Business case development resources have been allocated and analysis completed

Organizations should resist pressure to rush business cases through Gate 2 before they are complete. Incomplete business cases waste governance time and typically result in requests for rework that delay decisions more than ensuring completeness upfront.

### Required Deliverables

Gate 2 requires comprehensive business justification and planning foundation:

**Full Business Case** represents the primary decision document, providing comprehensive justification following organizational standards. A complete business case includes:

- **Executive Summary** (1-2 pages) that concisely presents the problem, solution, financial analysis, risks, and recommendation
- **Business Problem/Opportunity Analysis** that describes current state, quantifies business impact, explains why action is required now, and establishes urgency
- **Current State Assessment** documenting existing capabilities, processes, systems, and performance to establish baseline
- **Future State Vision** articulating the desired end state, capabilities to be delivered, and how the future state addresses the business problem
- **Solution Approach** describing the recommended solution with sufficient detail to enable cost estimation and risk assessment
- **Implementation Approach** outlining how the solution will be deployed, what phases are planned, and what major activities are required

**Financial Analysis** provides rigorous financial evaluation using organizational standards and methodologies. Complete financial analysis includes:

- **Cost Analysis** documenting all investment costs including direct project costs (labor, contractors, software licenses, hardware), indirect costs (overhead, training, support), ongoing operational costs (maintenance, licensing, support staff), and opportunity costs
- **Benefits Analysis** quantifying expected benefits by category (cost reduction, cost avoidance, revenue increase, productivity improvement, risk reduction) with clear calculation methodology and assumptions
- **Financial Metrics** calculating standard measures including Net Present Value (NPV), Return on Investment (ROI), Payback Period, Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- **Sensitivity Analysis** examining how results change with different assumptions about costs, benefits, timing, and other variables
- **Financial Comparison** of alternatives considered, explaining why the recommended approach offers superior financial value

Financial analysis must meet defined thresholds to proceed:

| Metric | Requirement | Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Net Present Value (NPV)** | Required | Greater than $0 |
| **Return on Investment (ROI)** | Required | Exceeds organizational hurdle rate |
| **Payback Period** | Required | Less than 36 months (typical) |
| **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** | Recommended | Exceeds cost of capital |

Organizations should establish financial thresholds that reflect their investment philosophy, with more aggressive thresholds for discretionary investments and potentially relaxed thresholds for strategic or mandatory investments.

**Benefits Statement** defines expected benefits with sufficient specificity to enable measurement and accountability. Effective benefits statements identify each specific benefit, quantify the benefit with clear calculation methodology, assign ownership for benefit realization to specific individuals, establish baseline measurements and target outcomes, define measurement approach and timing, and map benefits to strategic objectives.

Leading organizations distinguish between different benefit types:
- **Cost Reduction** - Measurable decrease in actual spending
- **Cost Avoidance** - Prevention of cost increases that would otherwise occur
- **Revenue Increase** - Growth in revenue attributable to the investment
- **Productivity Improvement** - Increased output or reduced effort for given work
- **Risk Reduction** - Decreased probability or impact of negative events
- **Capability Enablement** - Creation of capabilities that enable future benefits

Each benefit type requires different measurement approaches and accountability models.

**Risk Assessment** evaluates investment-specific risks and mitigation strategies. Comprehensive risk assessment identifies key risks (technical complexity, organizational change resistance, resource availability, vendor dependency, schedule constraints, regulatory uncertainty), assesses each risk for probability and impact, documents mitigation strategies for high-priority risks, calculates risk-adjusted financial metrics, and identifies residual risks that cannot be fully mitigated.

Risk assessment should be realistic rather than optimistic. Organizations that consistently underestimate risks in business cases experience predictable project failures and benefits shortfalls.

**Alternative Analysis** demonstrates that alternatives have been seriously considered and the recommended approach offers the best value. Effective alternative analysis examines options such as do nothing (what happens if we don't invest), minimal approach (lowest viable investment), recommended approach (balance of value and risk), comprehensive approach (maximum investment for maximum benefit), and build vs. buy vs. partner alternatives.

Alternative analysis should fairly evaluate each option using consistent criteria and clearly explain why the recommended approach is superior.

**High-Level Plan** provides initial timeline and major milestones without detailed project planning. The high-level plan identifies major phases or stages, key milestones and deliverables, overall timeline from start to deployment, major dependencies on other work or external factors, and assumptions about resource availability.

The high-level plan should be realistic about duration and complexity, avoiding the common trap of optimistic planning that inevitably leads to delays and disappointment.

**Resource Estimate** details budget and resource requirements with improved accuracy compared to Gate 1 ROM estimates. The resource estimate should have a range of approximately -10%/+25%, reflecting increased understanding while acknowledging remaining uncertainties. The estimate addresses labor costs by role and skill, contractor and consulting costs, software licenses and subscriptions, hardware and infrastructure costs, training and change management costs, and contingency reserves for risk and uncertainty.

### Gate Review Process

Gate 2 review follows a structured process that typically includes:

**Pre-Review** (1-2 weeks before formal review): Business case materials are distributed to Investment Review Board members, allowing time for review and question preparation. Pre-review circulation is essential for effective meetings; governance bodies cannot adequately evaluate complex business cases during the meeting itself.

**Sponsor Presentation** (15-30 minutes): The business sponsor presents the business case, typically covering the business problem, recommended solution, financial analysis, key risks, and request for approval. Effective sponsors focus on business value and strategic alignment rather than technical details.

**Question and Answer** (15-30 minutes): Investment Review Board members ask questions to clarify understanding, probe assumptions, test risk assessment, and ensure the business case is sound. Effective governance asks probing questions rather than accepting presentations at face value.

**Deliberation** (15-30 minutes): Investment Review Board discusses the proposal, shares perspectives, considers portfolio context, and reaches a decision. Deliberation typically occurs without the sponsor present to enable candid discussion.

**Decision Communication** (5-10 minutes): The Investment Review Board chair communicates the decision to the sponsor with rationale and any conditions or next steps.

### Scoring and Prioritization

Gate 2 review includes applying standardized scoring criteria to enable comparative prioritization across the portfolio. Most organizations use multi-dimensional scoring frameworks typically assessing:

**Business Value Score (0-5 scale)** evaluates:
- Strategic alignment to organizational objectives
- Financial return (NPV, ROI, payback)
- Business urgency and timing sensitivity
- Customer or employee impact
- Competitive positioning impact

**Risk Score (0-5 scale)** evaluates:
- Technical complexity and feasibility
- Organizational change magnitude
- Resource availability and skills
- Vendor dependency and reliability
- Implementation duration and complexity

**Cost Score (0-5 scale)** evaluates:
- Total investment magnitude
- Resource intensity and scarcity
- Opportunity cost of resource allocation
- Multi-year cost trajectory

These dimensional scores combine into a Priority Score using organizational weighting formulas, typically: Priority Score = (Business Value Score × 0.5) - (Risk Score × 0.3) - (Cost Score × 0.2)

Scoring enables objective prioritization while acknowledging that scores inform rather than dictate decisions. Governance retains discretion to advance lower-scoring investments for strategic or mandatory reasons.

### Decision Options

Gate 2 review results in one of three decision options:

**Approve for Planning** authorizes allocation of planning resources to develop detailed plans, typically 5-10% of total project investment. Approval should specify approved budget for planning, assigned project manager and resources, target date for Gate 3 review, any conditions that must be met during planning, and priority level that guides resource allocation.

Approval at Gate 2 does not guarantee approval at Gate 3. Organizations should clearly communicate that Gate 2 approves planning investment, not execution funding, and Gate 3 will evaluate detailed plans before authorizing major resource commitment.

**Defer** holds the investment for future consideration, typically for reasons such as timing relative to strategic priorities, resource constraints preventing near-term planning, need for additional information or analysis, or dependency on other work that must complete first.

Deferral should include clear explanation of the reason and conditions for reconsideration. Deferred investments should be reviewed periodically to determine if circumstances have changed.

**Reject** declines the investment, typically for reasons such as business case does not meet financial thresholds, risks are unacceptable relative to expected value, strategic alignment is insufficient, alternatives provide better value, or organizational capacity is insufficient.

Rejection should be communicated clearly and respectfully with specific rationale. Rejected proposals can be resubmitted if circumstances change or the business case is substantially strengthened.

### Gate 2 Success Factors

Effective Gate 2 implementation requires:

**Clear Business Case Standards** that define required content, financial analysis rigor, and documentation format. Standards should be rigorous enough to ensure quality while pragmatic enough to be achievable.

**Financial Analysis Expertise** from finance professionals who validate assumptions, review methodologies, and ensure financial rigor. Finance should be a partner in business case development rather than merely a reviewer.

**Adequate Review Time** for Investment Review Board members to thoroughly review materials before meetings. Organizations should target 1-2 weeks of pre-review time for significant investments.

**Skilled Facilitation** by Investment Review Board chairs who keep reviews focused, ensure balanced participation, and drive to clear decisions.

**Decision Discipline** to consistently apply criteria, resist political pressure for favorable decisions, and defer or reject investments that don't meet standards.

---

## Gate 3: Execution Approval

Gate 3 represents the major funding decision, authorizing full execution budget and resources based on detailed planning that demonstrates viability, feasibility, and readiness. This gate implements the most rigorous scrutiny because approval commits the majority of project investment.

### Purpose and Governance

The fundamental purpose of Gate 3 is to evaluate detailed plans, validate resource commitments, confirm financial viability remains sound, assess execution readiness, and authorize major funding commitment. Gate 3 typically authorizes 80-90% of total project investment, making it the most consequential approval in the investment lifecycle.

Decision authority for Gate 3 typically rests with the Portfolio Steering Committee for significant investments, while the Investment Review Board may retain authority for smaller investments within their delegated limits. Steering Committee involvement reflects the strategic importance and resource magnitude of execution decisions.

### Entry Criteria

Investments enter Gate 3 when:
- Gate 2 approval has been granted authorizing planning
- Planning resources have been allocated and planning is complete
- Detailed project plan meets organizational quality standards
- Budget and resource requirements have been validated
- Planning investment has been completed within authorized budget

Organizations should enforce Gate 3 entry criteria consistently, resisting pressure to present incomplete plans or proceed without adequate planning to "start faster."

### Required Deliverables

Gate 3 requires comprehensive planning and execution readiness:

**Detailed Project Plan** provides complete work breakdown, schedule, milestones, and deliverables. A complete project plan includes:

- **Work Breakdown Structure** decomposing the project into manageable work packages with clear ownership and completion criteria
- **Detailed Schedule** showing task dependencies, critical path, resource loading, and milestone dates with realistic duration estimates
- **Major Milestones** defining key decision points, deliverables, and phase completions that enable progress tracking
- **Quality Standards** establishing what "done" means for deliverables and how quality will be validated
- **Dependencies** documenting prerequisites, related work, and external dependencies that could affect schedule or success

**Detailed Budget** provides line-item budget with contingency reserves. The detailed budget should include:

- **Resource Costs** by role, individual (where known), duration, and fully loaded rate
- **Contractor Costs** with statements of work, deliverables, and payment terms
- **License and Subscription Costs** for all software, platforms, and services required
- **Hardware and Infrastructure Costs** including equipment, hosting, and capacity
- **Training and Change Management Costs** for user enablement and adoption
- **Contingency Reserves** sized based on risk assessment (typically 10-20% for moderate risk projects)

Budget accuracy should be -5%/+15% at Gate 3, reflecting detailed planning while acknowledging that some uncertainty remains.

**Resource Plan** identifies resources by name where possible, with skills and timing for all roles. The resource plan should address:

- **Named Resources** for key roles with confirmed availability and commitment
- **Resource-to-Role Mapping** for positions still to be filled with required skills and experience
- **Resource Timeline** showing when resources join and leave the project
- **Resource Loading** demonstrating resources are not over-allocated across multiple projects
- **Skills Gaps** identifying where capabilities need to be developed or contracted

Resource plans should be realistic about availability. Organizations that consistently plan with optimistic resource assumptions experience predictable delays and execution failures.

**Risk Management Plan** provides detailed risk identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies. A comprehensive risk management plan includes:

- **Risk Register** documenting all identified risks with probability, impact, and current status
- **Top 10 Risks** highlighting the most significant threats with detailed mitigation plans
- **Risk Response Strategies** for each major risk (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept)
- **Risk Triggers** defining early warning indicators that risks are materializing
- **Risk Reserves** allocating budget and schedule contingency to address risk events
- **Risk Monitoring** establishing how risks will be tracked and managed during execution

Risk management should be proactive rather than reactive, with clear mitigation strategies in place before execution begins.

**Benefits Realization Plan** details how benefits will be tracked and measured post-implementation. The benefits realization plan should include:

- **Benefit-by-Benefit Plans** for each quantified benefit showing baseline measurement, target outcome, measurement methodology, measurement timing, and assigned owner
- **Benefits Timeline** showing when different benefits are expected to materialize
- **Benefits Tracking Process** defining who collects data, how data is validated, and how results are reported
- **Benefits Accountability** assigning ownership to specific business leaders who commit to benefit realization
- **Benefits Risks** identifying factors that could prevent benefit realization with mitigation strategies

Benefits realization planning is frequently neglected but essential for accountability and continuous improvement.

**Change Management Plan** addresses organizational change impacts and adoption strategy. A comprehensive change management plan includes:

- **Change Impact Assessment** identifying affected stakeholders, required behavior changes, and change magnitude
- **Stakeholder Engagement Strategy** defining how different stakeholder groups will be engaged and prepared
- **Communication Plan** establishing what will be communicated, to whom, when, and through which channels
- **Training Plan** detailing training approach, materials, delivery methods, and schedule
- **Adoption Metrics** defining how adoption and change resistance will be measured
- **Change Sustainability** ensuring changes are reinforced and institutionalized

Change management is often the difference between technical success and business value realization.

**Communication Plan** establishes stakeholder communication approach throughout execution. The communication plan should address:

- **Stakeholder Analysis** identifying key stakeholders with their information needs and preferences
- **Communication Matrix** defining what information goes to which stakeholders at what frequency
- **Status Reporting** establishing regular project status updates and format
- **Escalation Process** clarifying how and when issues are escalated
- **Change Communication** ensuring portfolio changes are communicated to affected stakeholders

### Plan Quality Criteria

Gate 3 applies specific quality criteria to ensure plans are realistic and achievable:

| Criterion | Requirement | Assessment Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Schedule Confidence** | ≥80% probability | Schedule risk analysis, historical benchmarking |
| **Budget Accuracy** | -5%/+15% range | Independent estimate validation, historical accuracy |
| **Resources Confirmed** | Key roles named | Resource manager commitments, availability verification |
| **Risks Managed** | Top 10 with mitigations | Risk assessment review, mitigation plan adequacy |
| **Dependencies Documented** | All external dependencies | Dependency validation, mitigation for unmet dependencies |
| **Quality Standards** | Clear acceptance criteria | Deliverable definitions, quality gate criteria |
| **Change Approach** | Stakeholder preparation | Change impact assessment, adoption strategy |

Organizations should validate plan quality through independent review rather than accepting project team assessments at face value.

### Gate Review Process

Gate 3 review typically follows a more extensive process than earlier gates:

**Pre-Review** (2-3 weeks before): Detailed planning materials are distributed to Steering Committee members. The extended pre-review time reflects the volume and complexity of Gate 3 materials.

**Technical Review** (1 week before): Enterprise architecture, security, infrastructure, and other technical reviewers assess technical aspects of the plan to identify concerns before Steering Committee review.

**Financial Validation** (1 week before): Finance validates budget assumptions, reviews cost estimates, confirms budget availability, and assesses financial viability.

**Sponsor Presentation** (30-45 minutes): Business sponsor and project manager present the detailed plan, covering scope, approach, schedule, budget, risks, change management, and benefits realization approach.

**Deep Dive Discussion** (30-45 minutes): Steering Committee asks probing questions about plan assumptions, risk mitigation, resource commitments, and execution readiness.

**Deliberation and Decision** (15-30 minutes): Steering Committee discusses the investment in portfolio context, assesses readiness to proceed, and reaches a decision.

### Decision Options

Gate 3 review results in one of three decision options:

**Approve to Execute** authorizes full execution budget and resources, committing the major project investment. Approval should specify:
- Approved scope and any scope constraints
- Authorized budget with any conditions
- Committed resources and timing
- Key milestones requiring governance review
- Reporting requirements and frequency
- Priority level affecting resource allocation

Approval should be explicit and documented to prevent ambiguity about what has been authorized.

**Revise Plan** requires changes to address identified gaps, concerns, or risks before approval. Revision requests should be specific about what needs to change and provide opportunity to resubmit for approval within 2-4 weeks. Common revision reasons include:
- Inadequate risk mitigation for key risks
- Resource plan that is unrealistic or over-allocated
- Schedule that is too aggressive or poorly sequenced
- Budget that lacks adequate contingency
- Insufficient change management for organizational impact

**Cancel** terminates the investment, typically because detailed planning revealed that the investment is not viable, risks are unacceptable, business case no longer holds, resources are not available, or portfolio priorities have changed. Cancellation should be communicated clearly with rationale. While cancellation may feel like failure, it represents the gate process working correctly by preventing investment in non-viable projects.

### Gate 3 Success Factors

Effective Gate 3 implementation requires:

**Planning Standards** defining what constitutes adequate planning, with templates, examples, and quality criteria. Standards should be consistent across projects while accommodating different project types.

**Independent Review** by enterprise architecture, security, infrastructure, and other specialists to validate technical aspects before governance review.

**Adequate Governance Time** for thorough review given the investment magnitude and commitment being made. Steering Committees should allocate 90+ minutes for significant investments.

**Resource Manager Accountability** requiring resource managers to validate and commit to resource plans rather than accepting project manager wishes.

**Decision Courage** to revise or cancel investments when plans are inadequate or circumstances have changed, even when political pressure exists to proceed.

## Gate 4: Execution Readiness Confirmation

Gate 4 provides a final readiness check before actual work begins, confirming that resources are available, contracts are executed, risks have no critical blockers, and execution can proceed smoothly. While Gate 3 approved the plan and committed resources, Gate 4 validates that commitments are now reality.

### Purpose and Governance

The fundamental purpose of Gate 4 is to prevent false starts where projects are approved but cannot actually execute due to resource unavailability, unexecuted contracts, unresolved dependencies, or critical risk events. Gate 4 is intentionally lightweight compared to previous gates, focused on verification rather than evaluation.

Decision authority for Gate 4 typically rests with the Portfolio Manager, who verifies readiness and authorizes work to proceed. Escalation to governance bodies occurs if readiness criteria cannot be met.

### Entry Criteria

Projects enter Gate 4 when:
- Gate 3 approval has been granted authorizing execution
- Target start date approaches (typically 2-4 weeks out)
- Resources should be available per approved plan
- Contracts and agreements should be executed
- Dependencies should be satisfied or mitigated

### Readiness Verification

Gate 4 applies a verification checklist rather than subjective evaluation:

| Readiness Item | Verification Required | Validation Method |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Budget Available** | Confirmed | Finance confirms funds allocated in financial system |
| **Resources Assigned** | Confirmed | Resource managers confirm assignments and availability |
| **Contracts Executed** | If applicable | Procurement confirms signed contracts and statements of work |
| **No Critical Risks** | Confirmed | Project manager confirms no critical blocking risks |
| **Kickoff Scheduled** | Confirmed | Meeting scheduled with key stakeholders |
| **Stakeholders Informed** | Confirmed | Communication sent to affected stakeholders |
| **Governance Established** | Confirmed | Steering, review meetings scheduled |
| **Dependencies Satisfied** | Confirmed | Dependent work complete or mitigation in place |

All items must be verified before execution proceeds. Items that cannot be verified trigger delay or escalation.

### Decision Options

Gate 4 verification results in one of three outcomes:

**Proceed to Execution** authorizes work to begin, with formal project kickoff, resource mobilization, and contract activation. Proceeding should be communicated to stakeholders and governance bodies.

**Delay Start** postpones execution start, typically because resources are not yet available, contracts are not yet executed, critical dependencies are not yet satisfied, or risk conditions require resolution. Delay should specify what must change and when readiness will be reassessed.

**Escalate** raises issues that require governance intervention, such as resources that were committed but are no longer available, changed business conditions affecting the investment, or risk events that require governance decision about proceeding.

### Success Factors

Effective Gate 4 implementation requires:

**Proactive Planning** to identify readiness issues well before planned start dates, enabling resolution rather than last-minute delays.

**Resource Manager Accountability** for delivering on resource commitments made at Gate 3, with escalation when commitments cannot be met.

**Clear Authority** for Portfolio Manager to delay starts when readiness criteria are not met, preventing pressure to proceed when not ready.

## Gate 5: Go-Live Approval

Gate 5 authorizes deployment to production environment, confirming that development is complete, testing validates quality, operations is ready to support, and business is prepared for transition. This gate prevents premature deployments that create operational problems and business disruption.

### Purpose and Governance

The fundamental purpose of Gate 5 is to ensure deployment readiness across technical, operational, and business dimensions before releasing to production. Gate 5 prevents the common pattern of schedule-driven deployments that meet dates but deliver poor quality, operational instability, or inadequate user readiness.

Decision authority for Gate 5 typically involves both business sponsor and IT leadership, as both must confirm readiness from their perspectives. Some organizations implement formal release management boards that provide Gate 5 approval.

### Entry Criteria

Projects enter Gate 5 when:
- Development is complete per project plan
- Testing has been completed with results meeting quality standards
- Deployment plan has been developed and reviewed
- Operations readiness assessment has been performed
- Business readiness assessment has been performed

### Go-Live Readiness Assessment

Gate 5 applies comprehensive readiness criteria across multiple dimensions:

**Technical Readiness** confirms:
- All planned functionality has been delivered and tested
- Defects have been identified, assessed, and resolved or accepted
- Performance testing validates the solution meets performance requirements
- Security testing confirms security controls are adequate
- Integration testing validates interfaces to other systems
- Infrastructure is provisioned and configured correctly
- Deployment automation is tested and ready

**Operational Readiness** confirms:
- Operations team has been trained on support procedures
- Support documentation is complete and accurate
- Monitoring and alerting is configured and tested
- Incident management procedures are defined
- Escalation paths are established
- Backup and recovery procedures are tested
- Operations team confirms readiness to support

**Business Readiness** confirms:
- End user training has been completed
- Business processes are documented and communicated
- Business stakeholders are prepared for changes
- Change management activities are complete
- Business sponsor confirms readiness to go live
- Support resources are identified and ready

**Risk Readiness** confirms:
- Go-live risks have been assessed and are acceptable
- Mitigation strategies are in place for major risks
- Rollback plan has been developed and tested
- Communication plan is ready for go-live
- Issue resolution process is established

### Go-Live Checklist

Organizations typically implement detailed go-live checklists:

| Category | Specific Items | Sign-Off Required |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Quality** | Testing complete, defects resolved, performance validated | QA Lead, Technical Lead |
| **Training** | User training delivered, materials published, support trained | Training Lead, Business Sponsor |
| **Operations** | Monitoring configured, support procedures ready, team trained | Operations Manager |
| **Business** | Processes documented, stakeholders prepared, change ready | Business Sponsor |
| **Risk** | Risks assessed, mitigations ready, rollback tested | Project Manager, Risk Owner |
| **Communication** | Stakeholders informed, support ready, expectations set | Communications Lead |
| **Approval** | Business sign-off, IT sign-off, governance informed | Business Sponsor, IT Leadership |

### Decision Options

Gate 5 review results in one of three decision options:

**Approve Deployment** authorizes production deployment per the deployment plan. Approval should specify deployment window, rollback criteria, monitoring requirements, and communication expectations. Post-deployment, stabilization period (typically 2-4 weeks) should be planned with heightened support and monitoring.

**Delay Deployment** postpones go-live, typically because readiness criteria are not met, quality concerns exist, business is not ready, or risk conditions are unacceptable. Delay should specify what must change and when readiness will be reassessed. Organizations should resist schedule pressure to deploy when not ready, as the cost of operational problems exceeds schedule delay costs.

**Cancel Deployment** aborts the project, typically because testing revealed fundamental problems, business conditions changed, or the solution is not viable. While rare at Gate 5, cancellation prevents throwing good money after bad when projects should not proceed.

### Success Factors

Effective Gate 5 implementation requires:

**Independent Quality Validation** by QA teams rather than relying solely on development team assessments.

**Operations Involvement** throughout development rather than at the end, ensuring operational concerns are addressed proactively.

**Business Sponsor Authority** to delay deployment if business is not ready, overriding schedule pressure from project teams.

**Go/No-Go Discipline** to consistently apply criteria and prevent schedule-driven deployments that sacrifice quality or readiness.

## Gate 6: Project Closure

Gate 6 formally closes the project and transitions to steady-state operations, ensuring deliverables are complete, documentation is adequate, operations has accepted responsibility, and benefits tracking is initiated. Formal closure prevents projects from lingering indefinitely in ambiguous states.

### Purpose and Governance

The fundamental purpose of Gate 6 is to formally complete the project, release resources, capture lessons learned, and establish benefits tracking. Many organizations neglect formal closure, allowing projects to gradually wind down without clear completion. This ambiguity prevents resource release, obscures portfolio capacity, and enables benefit accountability to dissolve.

Decision authority for Gate 6 typically involves the business sponsor confirming satisfaction with deliverables and the Portfolio Manager confirming closure requirements are met.

### Entry Criteria

Projects enter Gate 6 when:
- Deployment is complete and stable
- Stabilization period has passed (typically 2-4 weeks post-deployment)
- Operations handover has been completed
- No critical issues remain unresolved
- Remaining work is operational rather than project work

### Closure Deliverables

Gate 6 requires several closure deliverables:

**Final Project Report** summarizes project outcomes compared to plan. The final project report should include:
- Project objectives and scope (original and final)
- Schedule performance (planned vs. actual)
- Budget performance (planned vs. actual)
- Scope delivery (delivered vs. planned)
- Key accomplishments and challenges
- Outstanding items and transition to operations

**Lessons Learned** documents what went well, what went poorly, and what should be done differently in future projects. Effective lessons learned should be:
- Specific and actionable rather than generic
- Balanced between successes and failures
- Focused on process and approach rather than blaming individuals
- Captured in organizational knowledge base for future reference

**Complete Documentation** ensures technical and operational documentation is complete, accurate, and accessible. Documentation requirements typically include:
- Technical architecture and design documents
- Operational procedures and runbooks
- User documentation and training materials
- Configuration documentation
- Interface specifications

**Formal Operations Handover** transfers support responsibility from project team to operations. Handover typically includes:
- Knowledge transfer sessions with operations team
- Transition of documentation and access
- Support period with project team available for consultation
- Formal acceptance by operations manager

**Benefits Baseline** establishes initial benefits measurement to enable subsequent tracking. Benefits baseline should:
- Document baseline measurement for each quantified benefit
- Establish measurement schedule for benefits tracking
- Confirm benefits ownership assignments
- Set target review dates for Gate 7

**Project Archive** ensures project artifacts are retained per organizational retention policies. Archives typically include business case, project plans, status reports, change logs, issues and risks, contracts and statements of work, and financial records.

### Closure Criteria

Gate 6 applies specific criteria that must be met for formal closure:

| Criterion | Requirement | Validation Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Deliverables Complete** | All scope delivered | Sponsor confirms satisfaction or approved changes |
| **Documentation Complete** | Meets standards | Documentation review against standards |
| **Operations Handover** | Formally accepted | Operations manager confirms acceptance |
| **Financials Closed** | Budget reconciled | Finance confirms all POs closed, actuals recorded |
| **Resources Released** | Team transitioned | Resource managers confirm team members released |
| **Lessons Captured** | Documented and shared | Lessons learned session completed and documented |
| **Benefits Tracking** | Initiated | Benefits baseline established, tracking scheduled |

### Decision Options

Gate 6 review results in one of two outcomes:

**Close Project** formally completes the project, releases resources, and archives project materials. Closure should be communicated to stakeholders and governance bodies. Benefits tracking continues per the benefits realization plan but project is formally complete.

**Extend Project** continues project status, typically because additional work is required to complete deliverables, documentation is incomplete, or operations is not ready to accept handover. Extension should specify what must be completed and target closure date. Organizations should avoid indefinite extensions that obscure true project status.

### Success Factors

Effective Gate 6 implementation requires:

**Closure Standards** defining what constitutes adequate closure with templates and examples.

**Timely Closure** soon after stabilization rather than allowing projects to linger indefinitely. Organizations should target closure within 4-6 weeks of deployment.

**Lessons Learned Emphasis** treating lessons learned as valuable organizational assets rather than bureaucratic checkbox.

**Benefits Tracking Accountability** ensuring benefits baseline is established and benefits owner is engaged before project closure.

---

## Gate 7: Benefits Realization

Gate 7 validates that expected benefits are being realized, compares actuals to business case projections, analyzes variances, and formally closes benefits tracking. This gate completes the investment lifecycle and enables accountability for value realization.

### Purpose and Governance

The fundamental purpose of Gate 7 is to verify benefits realization, understand variance from projections, capture lessons learned about benefit estimation and realization, and formally close the investment. Benefits realization review is the most frequently neglected gate despite being essential for accountability and continuous improvement.

Decision authority for Gate 7 typically rests with the Portfolio Steering Committee, as benefits realization validates the investment decisions they made at earlier gates.

### Entry Criteria

Investments enter Gate 7 when:
- Project has been closed at Gate 6
- Sufficient time has elapsed for benefits to materialize (typically 6-12 months)
- Benefits data has been collected per benefits realization plan
- Benefits owner has validated data accuracy

### Benefits Review Process

Gate 7 implements systematic benefits review:

**Benefits Data Collection** gathers actual performance data for each quantified benefit from business systems, operations metrics, or specific measurements. Data collection should follow the methodology defined in the benefits realization plan.

**Benefits Calculation** applies business case calculation methodology to actual data to determine realized benefits. Calculations should be performed consistently with business case projections to enable valid comparison.

**Variance Analysis** compares actual benefits to business case projections, identifying and analyzing significant variances. Analysis should distinguish between:
- Benefits that exceeded projections
- Benefits that met projections
- Benefits that partially realized
- Benefits that did not materialize

**Root Cause Analysis** investigates why benefits varied from projections, examining factors such as:
- Implementation quality and completeness
- Adoption and change management effectiveness
- Business process changes supporting benefit realization
- External factors affecting business conditions
- Projection methodology and assumptions

**Lessons Learned** capture insights about benefit estimation, realization strategies, and improvement opportunities for future investments.

### Benefits Assessment

Gate 7 applies criteria to assess overall benefits achievement:

| Outcome | Criteria | Implications |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Benefits Realized** | Actual ≥85% of projected | Close benefits tracking, celebrate success |
| **Partial Benefits** | Actual 50-84% of projected | Develop remediation plan, continue tracking |
| **Benefits Shortfall** | Actual <50% of projected | Root cause analysis, escalate lessons learned |

Benefits assessment should be objective and fact-based rather than influenced by desire to declare success.

### Decision Options

Gate 7 review results in one of three outcomes:

**Benefits Realized** formally closes benefits tracking when benefits have met or exceeded projections. Closure should include documentation of actual benefits achieved, communication of success to stakeholders and governance, recognition of benefits owners who achieved results, and lessons learned about what enabled success.

**Remediation Plan** continues benefits tracking with specific actions to improve benefit realization when benefits are partially realized. Remediation typically includes identifying specific actions to improve benefit realization, assigning ownership for remediation actions, establishing tracking schedule to monitor improvement, and targeting follow-up review in 3-6 months.

**Write Off Benefits** formally acknowledges that benefits will not be realized and closes tracking when benefits have fundamentally failed to materialize. Write-off should include root cause analysis of why benefits failed, lessons learned documentation and sharing, assessment of whether similar investments should proceed differently, and formal closure communication to governance.

Organizations should resist pressure to prematurely close benefits tracking or declare success when benefits have not materialized. Benefits accountability is essential for portfolio management credibility.

### Benefits Realization Metrics

Organizations should track portfolio-level benefits realization metrics:

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Benefits Realization Rate** | ≥85% | Percent of projected benefits actually realized |
| **Benefit Accuracy** | ±20% | Average variance between projected and actual benefits |
| **Benefits Review Compliance** | 100% | Percent of projects with completed Gate 7 review |
| **Time to Benefits** | Per projection | Actual time to benefit realization vs. projected |

These metrics enable continuous improvement in benefit estimation and realization strategies.

### Success Factors

Effective Gate 7 implementation requires:

**Executive Commitment** to benefits accountability, resisting organizational tendency to skip benefits tracking.

**Benefits Owner Accountability** with clear expectations that business leaders own benefit realization, not IT.

**Data Infrastructure** enabling efficient benefits data collection without excessive manual effort.

**Lessons Integration** feeding benefits lessons back into portfolio analysis to improve estimation and scoring.

---

## Fast-Track Process

While the full seven-gate process provides appropriate rigor for significant investments, smaller, lower-risk investments benefit from streamlined fast-track approaches that maintain discipline while reducing overhead.

### When to Fast-Track

Fast-track processes should be applied to investments meeting specific criteria:

| Criteria | Threshold | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Total Investment** | <$100K | Limited financial exposure reduces risk |
| **Duration** | <3 months | Short duration limits exposure and complexity |
| **Risk Level** | Low | Technical and organizational risks are minimal |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Confirmed | Clear alignment reduces evaluation needs |
| **Sponsor Pre-Approved** | Yes | Pre-approval validates business justification |
| **No External Dependencies** | None | Independence simplifies planning and execution |

All criteria should be met for fast-track eligibility. Investments not meeting criteria should follow standard process regardless of pressure to expedite.

### Fast-Track Process Design

Fast-track processes typically consolidate gates:

**Consolidated Approval (Gates 1-3 Combined):**
- Submit combined concept and business case (lighter weight than standard)
- Investment Review Board review in single session
- Approval to execute or rejection
- No separate planning gate; planning incorporated in initial submission

**Standard Process for Later Gates:**
- Gate 4 (Readiness) still applies to prevent false starts
- Gate 5 (Go-Live) still applies to ensure deployment readiness
- Gate 6 (Closure) may be simplified but should occur
- Gate 7 (Benefits) may be simplified for small investments

### Fast-Track Requirements

Even fast-track investments should require:

**Business Justification** articulating problem, solution, costs, benefits, and strategic alignment (lighter weight than full business case)

**Financial Analysis** demonstrating positive ROI or strategic necessity (simpler than full financial modeling)

**Risk Assessment** identifying key risks with mitigation strategies (focused on major risks)

**Resource Plan** confirming resource availability and commitments

**Approval Authority** from Investment Review Board or delegated manager

### Fast-Track Risks

Organizations should be aware of fast-track risks:

**Scope Creep** where small investments grow beyond fast-track thresholds
**Proliferation** where most investments claim fast-track eligibility
**Inadequate Planning** where speed compromises execution quality
**Accountability Erosion** where simplified process reduces benefits tracking

Mitigating these risks requires clear fast-track criteria, monitoring of fast-track portfolio size, enforcement of thresholds, and continued benefits accountability even for small investments.

---

## Lifecycle Metrics

Effective investment lifecycle management requires metrics that measure process health, decision quality, execution performance, and value realization.

### Stage-Gate Process Metrics

Organizations should track stage-gate process performance:

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Gate Cycle Time** | <2 weeks | Time from submission to decision at each gate |
| **Gate Pass Rate** | 60-80% | Percent advancing through each gate |
| **Gate Rework Rate** | <20% | Percent requiring resubmission after revision |
| **Process Compliance** | ≥95% | Percent following defined gate process |
| **Decision Turnaround** | <3 days | Time from review to decision communication |

These metrics identify process bottlenecks and ensure efficient decision-making.

### Investment Performance Metrics

Organizations should track investment outcomes:

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **On-Time Delivery** | ≥85% | Percent delivered within approved schedule |
| **On-Budget Delivery** | ≥90% | Percent delivered within approved budget |
| **Scope Delivery** | ≥95% | Percent delivering approved scope |
| **Benefits Realization** | ≥85% | Actual benefits vs. projected benefits |
| **Quality at Deployment** | <5% critical defects | Defect rate at go-live |
| **Stakeholder Satisfaction** | ≥4.0/5.0 | Sponsor and stakeholder satisfaction |

These metrics assess investment execution quality and value delivery.

### Portfolio-Level Metrics

Organizations should track overall portfolio performance:

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Portfolio Success Rate** | ≥80% | Percent completing successfully |
| **Average Benefit Accuracy** | ±20% | Average variance from projected benefits |
| **Resource Utilization** | 80-85% | Productive utilization of portfolio resources |
| **Investment Velocity** | Trending up | Time from idea to deployment |
| **Strategic Alignment** | ≥85% | Percent mapped to strategic objectives |

These metrics characterize overall portfolio health and strategic contribution.

### Leading vs. Lagging Metrics

Effective measurement balances leading indicators (predictive) with lagging indicators (historical):

**Leading Indicators** predict future performance:
- Gate quality scores (completeness of gate submissions)
- Planning thoroughness metrics
- Risk assessment completeness
- Stakeholder engagement levels
- Resource allocation conflicts

**Lagging Indicators** measure historical results:
- Schedule and budget variance
- Benefits realization rates
- Defect rates
- Stakeholder satisfaction
- Project success rates

Leading indicators enable proactive intervention while lagging indicators validate results.

## Review Questions

1. Explain the principle of progressive commitment and how the stage-gate model implements it through increasing decision authority and resource allocation.

2. Why are multiple decision points (Gates 1 and 2) required before major planning investment, and what distinct purpose does each serve?

3. What are the risks of approving execution at Gate 3 without adequate planning, and how do organizations rationalize this decision despite known risks?

4. How does Gate 4 (Readiness Confirmation) differ from Gate 3 (Execution Approval), and why is this separate gate necessary?

5. What dimensions of readiness must be assessed at Gate 5 (Go-Live), and why is each important for successful deployment?

6. Why is Gate 6 (Project Closure) frequently neglected, and what are the consequences of failing to formally close projects?

7. How does Gate 7 (Benefits Realization) create accountability for value delivery, and why is this gate often the most difficult to implement?

8. When is fast-track processing appropriate, and what risks must be managed when streamlining the stage-gate process?

9. How should organizations balance gate rigor (ensuring quality decisions) with gate efficiency (enabling appropriate speed)?

10. What metrics best indicate stage-gate process health, and how should organizations respond when metrics indicate problems?

---

## Summary

The stage-gate investment lifecycle provides disciplined governance for IT investments, implementing progressive commitment through seven decision points from idea qualification through benefits realization. Each gate serves a specific purpose, applies defined criteria, requires particular deliverables, and results in explicit decisions about whether to proceed, defer, or cancel investments.

Early gates (1-2) focus on strategic alignment and business justification, filtering ideas and authorizing business case development with modest resource investment. Gate 3 represents the major funding decision, authorizing execution only after detailed planning demonstrates viability. Gates 4-5 prevent false starts and premature deployments through readiness verification and go-live approval. Gates 6-7 ensure formal closure and validate benefits realization, creating accountability that distinguishes mature portfolio management from project-centric approaches.

Fast-track processes streamline small, low-risk investments while maintaining appropriate discipline. Lifecycle metrics enable process improvement, execution management, and accountability. Consistent application of gate criteria is essential for maintaining credibility and ensuring objective decision-making based on merit rather than politics.

Organizations that implement stage-gate discipline consistently achieve significantly better investment outcomes including strategic alignment, realistic planning, successful execution, and measurable value realization. Those that skip gates, apply criteria inconsistently, or allow political pressure to override objective evaluation inevitably experience higher failure rates, wasted resources, and unrealized benefits.
