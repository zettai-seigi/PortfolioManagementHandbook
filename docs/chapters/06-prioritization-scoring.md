# Chapter 6: Prioritization and Scoring

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Apply a structured scoring framework to IT investments
- Calculate business value, risk, and cost scores
- Determine priority rankings using weighted criteria
- Facilitate objective prioritization discussions
- Avoid common prioritization pitfalls

---

## The Scoring Framework

### Why Scoring Matters

Without objective scoring, portfolio decisions become:
- Political rather than strategic
- Influenced by the loudest voice
- Inconsistent across initiatives
- Difficult to justify or explain

Structured scoring provides:
- **Objectivity:** Data-driven decisions
- **Transparency:** Clear criteria everyone understands
- **Consistency:** Same framework applied to all
- **Defensibility:** Rationale for decisions

## Priority Calculation

### Priority Score Formula

```
Priority Score = (Business Value × 0.40) +
                 ((5 - Risk Score) × 0.30) +
                 ((5 - Cost Score) × 0.30)
```

**Note:** Risk and Cost are inverted (5 - score) because lower risk and lower cost are more favorable.

### Example Calculation

| Dimension | Raw Score | Weight | Adjusted |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Business Value | 4.2 | 40% | 1.68 |
| Risk (inverted) | 2.5 → 2.5 | 30% | 0.75 |
| Cost (inverted) | 3.0 → 2.0 | 30% | 0.60 |
| **Priority Score** | | | **3.03** |

### Priority Bands

| Priority | Score Range | Action | Funding |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **P1 - Critical** | > 5.0 | Must do | Immediate |
| **P2 - High** | 3.5 - 5.0 | Should do | This cycle |
| **P3 - Medium** | 2.0 - 3.5 | Could do | Next cycle |
| **P4 - Low** | 0 - 2.0 | Defer | Future |
| **P5 - Do Not Fund** | < 0 | Reject | Never |

## Scoring Process

### Scoring Session Format

**Participants:**
- Scoring committee (5-7 members)
- Business sponsor (presents)
- Portfolio analyst (facilitates)

**Duration:** 1-2 hours per initiative

**Agenda:**
1. Business case presentation (15-20 min)
2. Q&A and discussion (15-20 min)
3. Individual scoring (5-10 min)
4. Score discussion and calibration (15-20 min)
5. Final score agreement (5 min)

### Scoring Best Practices

**Do:**
- Score consistently across all initiatives
- Use the full range (0-5)
- Base scores on facts, not opinions
- Discuss and calibrate disagreements
- Document rationale for scores

**Don't:**
- Give everything a 3 (central tendency)
- Let one voice dominate
- Score based on sponsor influence
- Change scores without discussion
- Ignore minority viewpoints

---

## Scoring Governance

### Scoring Committee Composition

| Role | Perspective |
|------|-------------|
| Business executive(s) | Business value, strategic alignment |
| Finance representative | Financial analysis, cost |
| IT representative | Technical risk, feasibility |
| Enterprise architect | Architecture alignment |
| Portfolio manager | Portfolio balance, capacity |

### Calibration Sessions

Hold periodic calibration sessions to:
- Review past scoring decisions
- Assess actual vs. predicted outcomes
- Adjust scoring criteria if needed
- Ensure consistent interpretation
- Train new committee members

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Scoring Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Central tendency** | All scores cluster at 3 | Use full 0-5 range, force distribution |
| **Halo effect** | One dimension influences others | Score dimensions independently |
| **Anchor bias** | First score influences others | Individual scoring before discussion |
| **Political pressure** | Sponsors influence scores | Objective criteria, transparent process |
| **Incomplete data** | Scores based on assumptions | Require complete business cases |
| **Inconsistent criteria** | Different standards applied | Training, calibration sessions |

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Three dimensions** (Value, Risk, Cost) provide comprehensive evaluation
- **Weighted scoring** enables objective priority calculation
- **Scoring process** should be structured and consistent
- **Committee composition** ensures diverse perspectives
- **Calibration** maintains scoring consistency over time
- **Avoid common pitfalls** through training and governance

---

## Summary

Effective prioritization requires a structured scoring framework that evaluates business value, risk, and cost consistently across all initiatives. The scoring process should be transparent, objective, and well-governed. By using weighted criteria and calculating priority scores, organizations can make defensible investment decisions that maximize portfolio value while managing risk.
